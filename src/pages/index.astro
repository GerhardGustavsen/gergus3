    <p class="greeting">
      <span class="hi">HiðŸ‘‹,</span> and welcome to my corner of the internet! Here
      you can find my writings, and read about some of my projects. If you want,
      you may also leave me a note in the guestbook, or take a wander in my garden.
      If you are looking for some inspiration, you can instead check out the books
      I have read and the movies I love. I have also tried to collect some of my
      absolute favorite literature and art in the archive. Looking for other cool
      websites? Check out my links! Hope you enjoy your stay!
